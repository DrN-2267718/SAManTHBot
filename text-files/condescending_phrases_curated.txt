Nice try
Good effort
Almost got it
Try again
Did you even *try* that time?
An attempt was made
Really?
Is that even close to a real command?
Having keyboard issues?
Is your monitor plugged in?
Maybe try look at what you're typing next time
No
It's okay, many people struggle with basic spelling
The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist
I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce
Dr. N stole a program to interpret text using advanced artificial intelligence and with one stupid message you broke it, congrats on that
Messages like yours make me wish Dr. N never programmed me
I'm not even gonna acknowledge that one
I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you
Wow that was almost understandable, good job on the improvement
I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter
I don't work here. I'm a consultant
At least you're cute. Well, maybe *some*body finds you cute
It might look like I'm doing nothing, but I'm really quite busy. Please try not to waste my time so much
You are validating my inherent distrust of anyone other than Dr. N
I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public
Someday, we'll look back on this, laugh nervously and change the subject
You can do better than that
You are the greatest evidence against "Survival of the Fittest"
You know, I'm actually quite nice most of the time. You just annoy me
