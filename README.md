# SAManTHBot
the bot I've been making, have fun looking through this mess
feel free to use any or all of this code. i tend to take bits and pieces of other people's code to use it, so i'd be a hypocrite to not allow others to do the same with my work.
the botcode file referenced is not included as it only has the function "getKey()" which just returns my bot key, and i don't want to just share that around\n
if you have any changes you think could make this better feel free to send them my way, i'm still very much an amature so there is a lot i don't know about / don't realize isn't a good thing. in that vane if you see something that seems dumb or is a bad way of doing something you can just assume it's because i either don't know any better or it's a case where i make things more complicated than necessary, which is often
